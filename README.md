Implementation Plan
 There are around 2000 Anganwadis in Raipur district. Most of the Anganwadis have an Anganwadi
 worker, a helper, and a decent building. The buildings have a small play area as well. It was observed that
 most of the Anganwadi workers (AWWs) spend around 1.5 hours teaching foundational learning skills to
 children between the age of 3-6 years. A majority of AWWs possess adequate skills for interacting with
 children, and during these teaching sessions, they often engage in various random activities.
 The government has introduced a daily lesson plan aligned with NCF-FS 2022 for the AWWs which can
 help them execute age-appropriate activities related to all domains of development.
 Over a phased three-year time, we aim for 80% of Anganwadis to consistently adopt key early-year
 practices outlined in these lesson plans. This transformation aims to establish them as model centers,
 fostering a conducive learning environment for children and adequately preparing them for Grade 1.
 • Identify and elaborate on the key changes you would introduce in Anganwadi centers in a
 phased manner.
 • Outline the strategic steps and a phased implementation plan for bringing about these
 changes. Emphasize the key stakeholders involved, resources required, timeline, and
 potential challenges.
